# To-Do-List App

This is a simple Task List application that allows users to add, manage, and track their tasks. The application provides a user-friendly interface where tasks can be added, marked as completed, and removed. The tasks are stored using the browser's local storage, allowing users to retain their task list even after closing or refreshing the page.

## Features

- **Add Tasks:** Users can add new tasks by typing into the input box and clicking the "Add" button. If the input is empty, an alert will notify the user to write something.

- **Mark as Checked:** Checked tasks are visually marked, providing a clear indication of completed tasks.

- **Remove Tasks:**  Allows users to remove the corresponding task from the list.

- **Local Storage:** The application utilizes local storage to persist the task list. This means that tasks will be saved even if the user closes the browser or refreshes the page.
